I just found out about the <a title="Pacific Crest Trail (PCT)" href="http://www.pcta.org/about_trail/overview.asp">Pacific Crest Trail</a> (PCT) in episode 1 of seizoen 4 of the National Geographic tv-serie "<a title="NG America's Wild Spaces" href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/americas-wild-spaces/">America's Wild Spaces</a>".

"Whether you visit the PCT for a few hours or for a few weeks                      you'll surely find a uniquely Western scene that  will rejuvenate,                      inspire and surprise you. Two thousand six hundred  and fifty                      miles (2650 miles == 4 264,76 km) of adventure and discovery are waiting." -- pcta.org

Sound like the perfect way to roam through America, maybe not all by foot tho.

This is the first item on my list of holiday adventures that I would like to do, someday.
More will follow :)
