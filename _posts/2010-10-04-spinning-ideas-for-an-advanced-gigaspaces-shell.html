<strong>Update 2011-05-28:</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A colleague of mine did a create job getting a Gigaspaces Shell project started and working, thanks Jos :)</p>

As the original GigaSpaces command-line scripts and maven OpenSpaces plugin are far to minimalistic to be usefull for *real* world use. <del>I'm thinking of creating something to fill the gap!</del>

So, spinning some ideas for an advanced GigaSpaces shell which is usable in *real* world situations. I'm thinking of features like:
<ul>
	<li>Usable as interactive AND non-interactive shell</li>
	<li>Platform independend; it should run on all common platforms (win32/64, linux, mac, solaris, etc.) without external dependencies to platform specific commands</li>
	<li>Unified configuration and usage; configuration and usage of the shell must be the same on every platform and between interactive and non-interactive mode; there's *only* one way to do something!</li>
	<li>Option to go in a graphic Interactive shell, something Midnight Commander like so you can walk through a tree with all lookupgroups, gsa, gsc, gsm, lus, pu's, etc. with the tree at the left side and detailed info of the selected item at the right</li>
	<li>Support remote deployments
<blockquote>eg. move defined files over ssh (with possible gateway in between) to GS server or one that can connect to a lookupgroup(s). And deploy the files to specified lookupgroup(s) with specific properties/sla when needed</blockquote>
Some requirements can be gathered from the example above (with some extra fantasy :)):</li>
	<li>Deployable files must be definable</li>
	<li>Definable files can come from all kind of resources, eg.:
<ul>
	<li>Maven repo (configurable)</li>
	<li>FTP?</li>
	<li>HTTP(s)?</li>
	<li>Local disc</li>
	<li>..?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Definable files should be deployed in order of definement, as there often are dependencies between PU's. Undeploy should happen in reverse order.</li>
	<li>All kind of settings must be definable per deployable file, eg.:
<ul>
	<li>deployment properties</li>
	<li>sla</li>
	<li>...?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Ssh needs support for tunneling/gateway, where the gateway as possibly different login credentials as the final ssh login. Usage of Public-Private-keys must be possible.</li>
	<li>Deployment config must be highly modular, eg.:
<ul>
	<li>With a general config and possibility to override settings per deployment file</li>
	<li>Possibility to create config groups and extend them</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Statistics, all supported statistics by the GS Admin API must be usable</li>
	<li>The interactive and non-interactive shell must be intuitive, eg.:
<ul>
	<li>Has auto-completion support (eg. bash-like tab-tab auto-completion)</li>
	<li>Has command history support (eg. bash-like up-down history)</li>
	<li>Each command must have an usable and self-container help feature (eg. svn-like svn help {command} or svn {command} help)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Must be able to work with multiple hosts (something <a title="Capistrano" href="http://capify.org">Capistrano</a>/<a title="Fabric" href="http://fabfile.org">Fabric</a> like functionality)</li>
	<li>Must be configurable for multiple stages (eg. local, dev, integration, staging, preproduction, production)</li>
	<li>Support for quering spaces</li>
	<li>Show the full url's that webapps are bound to</li>
</ul>
So for short:
<blockquote>All possible GS Admin API features must be usable</blockquote>

JLine is used by projects like Spring Roo and GroovyShell. So even tho it's last update was in 2008, it seems to be working very nicely</li>

This can be a good resource to take a look at the implementation</li>
