I just found out about the [Pacific Crest Trail](http://www.pcta.org/about_trail/overview.asp) (PCT) in episode 1 of seizoen 4 of the National Geographic tv-serie "[NG America's Wild Spaces](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/americas-wild-spaces/ "America's Wild Spaces")".

> Whether you visit the PCT for a few hours or for a few weeks you'll surely find a uniquely Western scene that  will rejuvenate, inspire and surprise you. Two thousand six hundred and fifty miles (2650 miles == 4 264,76 km) of adventure and discovery are waiting.

Sound like the perfect way to roam through America, maybe not all by foot tho.

This is the first item on my list of holiday adventures that I would like to do, someday.
More will follow :)
